               <h1>Creating and Sharing a PGP Key</h1>
               <h2>For Beginners</h2>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Introduction</h2>

               <p>
               OpenPGP is a standard that is implemented by several
               applications.  There is the PGP application, which is
               commercial, but one of the most common is GPG (Gnu Privacy
               Guard) which is what we'll be using in this how-to.
               </p>

            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Install GPG</h2>

               <p>
               How you install GPG is largely system-specific.  The main thing
               to note is that you should be installing a fairly current
               version of GPG.  You want at least GPG 2.1.
               </p>

               <p>
               If your operating system's package manager doesn't provide a
               version of GPG that is at least 2.1, you can download a binary
               distribution from 
               <a href="https://gnupg.org/download/">https://gnupg.org/download/</a>.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2>Package Installs</h2>

               <p>Here are the package install commands for some common
               OSes.</p>

               <p><dl>
                  <dt>Debian</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% sudo apt-get install gnupg</div></dd>
                  <dt>RedHat</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% sudo yum install gnupg</div></dd>
                  <dt>Mac OS</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% brew install gpg</div></dd>

               <h2>Check The Version of GPG</h2>

               <p>
               Check that you've got at least GPG 2.1. Your input is in blue,
               below.  The output of gpg is in bright white.

               <h2>Create a New Key</h2>

               <p>
               Run gpg and create a key.
               </p>

               <div class="code">

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

               <h2>Set a Passphrase</h2>

               <p>
               When you say <em>Okay</em> to your entries, you'll be asked to
               enter a passphrase.  Choose a strong, but easy to remember
               passphrase and set it.
               </p>
               <p>
               <em>REMEMBER:</em> if someone gets a copy of your key, this
               passphrase is the only thing between them and their ability to
               impersonate you or read all of your encrypted email!
               </p>
               <p>
               Also remember, if you forget this passphrase, you will lose
               access to your key.
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Key Generation and Entropy</h2>

               <p>
               Once you set a passphrase, GPG will begin generating your key.
               To do this, it needs a large amount of <em>entropy</em>, or
               randomness, in order to generate some good large prime numbers.
               This may take a while, and GPG may ask you to create some
               activity on your computer in order to help its random number
               generator.
               </p>

            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>A note about Algorithms and Expiry</h2>

               <p>
               The default key generation option doesn't let you set the
               expiry date of your key, or the algorithm, or key size.  If you
               want to set these things you'll need to declare yourself an
               expert using the <span class="input">--full-generate-key</span>
               option.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2>Use Caution!</h2>
               <p>
               If you change anything from the defaults, be sure you know why
               you're doing it and what effect it might have.
               </p>
               <p>
               Don't pick an expiry date too far in the future, don't make
               your key size too small, and don't pick an algorithm that
               nobody else can make use of!
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Your New Key</h2>

               <p>
               Once GPG is done generating your key it will show you the new
               key's details, and exit.

               <p>
               The long hex string in the key info is your key's fingerprint.
               You can also get that in an easier-to-read format by explicitly
               asking for it.

               <p>
               The <span class="input">-a</span> option causes GPG to output
               ASCII instead of binary data.  The <span

               </p>
               <p>
               It's important to send the file as an attachment, because some
               mail clients can cause formatting problems with the key data
               that make it hard to import.
               </p>

               <p>
               Just before morning break on Friday, everyone's keys will be
               posted as a single export file in the Indico agenda for the key
               signing at <a
                  href="https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/32/contributions/739/">https://indico.dns-oarc.net/event/32/contributions/739/</a>
               </p>
               <p>
               Download this key file (keyring.asc) and its checksum file
               (keyring.md5).  We'll make an announcement when these files are
               ready to be downloaded.

               <h2>Confirm your Key</h2>

               <p>
               You'll need to take a few steps to confirm that the fingerprint
               for your key in the exported keyring is correct.  It's
               important that you verify that it's your key in the keyring!
               </p>
               <p>
               First, import the keyring into an <i>alternate</i> keyring file
               in gpg.

               <h2>Join Us At The Key Signing!</h2>

               <p>
               Now all you need to do is show up at the key signing, on Friday
               during lunch.  We'll be in the plenary room (where the rest of
               the conference has been) at 13:10.
               </p>
               <p>
               Bring with you:
               <ul>
                  <li>your laptop with the export keyring on it</li>
                  <li>some ID that others who do not know you can
                     trust (e.g. your passport).</li>
                  <li>a pen and paper, or some other way to take notes</li>
               </ul>
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>What to Expect</h2>

               <p>
               We will do three things during the key signing:
               <ol>
                  <li>Everyone will check that they have the correct keyring
                     file</li>
                  <li>Everyone will introduce themselves and declare which
                     key in the keyring is theirs, and whether the
                     fingerprints match their key.</li>
                  <li>Everyone will have an opportunity to verify the ID of
                     anyone they don't already know personally</li>
               </ol>
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Verifying the Keyring</h2>

               <p>
               We will post a checksum of the keyring file on the screen.
               Generate an md5 cheksum of the keyring.asc file you downloaded
               and make sure it matches.
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Verifying Keys</h2>

               <p>
               Everyone will state which key is theirs in the keyring (usually
               by calling out an email address in the key ID) and will state
               whether the fingerprint in the downloaded file is correct.
               </p>
               <p>
               Use the paper or note taking app you brought to take notes!
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Verifying Identities</h2>

               <p>
               We'll form a sports "handshake circle" for everyone to check
               ID.  Confirm that the people whose keys you're signing are who
               they say they are!
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>And that's it!</h2>

               <p>
               That completes the face to face portion of the key singing
               party!
               </p>
               <p>
               Everyone can go home and sign keys, then email the signed keys
               back to their owner, at their leisure.
               </p>
