            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Introduction</h2>

               <p>
               OpenPGP is a standard that is implemented by several
               applications.  There is the PGP application, which is
               commercial, but one of the most common is GPG (Gnu Privacy
               Guard) which is what we'll be using in this how-to.
               </p>

            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Install GPG</h2>

               <p>
               How you install GPG is largely system-specific.  The main thing
               to note is that you should be installing a fairly current
               version of GPG.  You want at least GPG 2.1.
               </p>

               <p>
               If your operating system's package manager doesn't provide a
               version of GPG that is at least 2.1, you can download a binary
               distribution from 
               <a href="https://gnupg.org/download/">https://gnupg.org/download/</a>.
               </p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2>Package Installs</h2>

               <p>Here are the package install commands for some common
               OSes.</p>

               <p><dl>
                  <dt>Debian</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% sudo apt-get install gnupg</div></dd>
                  <dt>RedHat</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% sudo yum install gnupg</div></dd>
                  <dt>Mac OS</dt>
                  <dd><div class="inline-code">% brew install gpg</div></dd>
               </dl></p>

               <h2>Check The Version of GPG</h2>

               <p>
               Check that you've got at least GPG 2.1. Your input is in blue,
               below.

               If it's not 2.1 or later, go back and download a binary
               distribution to install.

               <h2>Create a New Key</h2>

               <p>
               Run gpg and create a key.
               </p>

               <div class="code">
<span class="prompt">matt@keyparty:~

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: <span class="input">Jane Doe</span>
Email address: <span class="input">jane@example.com</span>
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Jane Doe &lt;jane@example.com&gt;"

               <h2>Set a Passphrase</h2>

               <p>
               When you say <em>Okay</em> to your entries, you'll be asked to
               enter a passphrase.  Choose a strong, but easy to remember
               passphrase and set it.
               </p>
               <p>
               <em>REMEMBER:</em> if someone gets a copy of your key, this
               passphrase is the only thing between them and their ability to
               impersonate you or read all of your encrypted email!
               </p>
               <p>
               Also remember, if you forget this passphrase, you will lose
               access to your key.
               </p>
            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Key Generation and Entropy</h2>

               <p>
               Once you set a passphrase, GPG will begin generating your key.
               To do this, it needs a large amount of <em>entropy</em>, or
               randomness, in order to generate some good large prime numbers.
               This may take a while, and GPG may ask you to create some
               activity on your computer in order to help its random number
               generator.
               </p>

            </section>

            <section>
               <h2>Your New Key</h2>

               <p>
               Once GPG is done generating your key it will show you the new
               key's details, and exit.
               </p>

               <p>
               Extract an ASCII text file that contains your public key.

               <p>
               The <span class="input">-a</span> option causes GPG to output
               ASCII instead of binary data.  The <span
               class="input">-o</span> option specifies an output file.
               </p>

               <p>
               Now all you need to do is show up at the key signing, on Sunday
               during lunch.
